            <h1>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin</b>, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March
                1935),
                also known as <b>Michael I. Pupin</b>, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist philanthropist and
                patriot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance
                telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
                wire (known as "pupinization").
            </p>
            <p>
                Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.
            </p>

            <h2>Early life and education</h2>
            <p>
                Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day
                municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always
                remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, <i>From Immigrant to Inventor</i> (1925):
            </p>
            <p>
                “My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you
                must provide yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful
                knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden
                ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life and
                leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German elementary
                school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best
                students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give
                Pupin a scholarship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many problems with
                Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued
                the sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin
                decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
                “When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five
                hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would
                have been the same. A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the
                money which he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie,
                which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred
                dollars, it would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which
                awaited me would have been the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless;
                it is not a handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he
                has the stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”
            </p>
            <h2>Studies in America and Ph.D</h2>
            <p>
                For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably at the biscuit
                factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private
                lectures. After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and
                entered Columbia College, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's
                predicted that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good
                oarsman. A popular student, he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors
                in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to
                Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of Electrical
                Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of physics and
                mathematics, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885),
                where he continued his schooling at the University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray
                imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of
                Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a
                photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the
                passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on January 2, 1896. Edison provided
                Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the
                exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin
                concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays,
                Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to
                enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image
                of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging
                failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour"
                which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen
                was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand
                and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained
                with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if "drawn with pen and ink." Dr. Bull was able to
                take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.
            </p>
            <h2>Pupin coils</h2>
            <p>
                Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work
                of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.
                The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &
                Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they
                already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin
                with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely
                valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine
                ones.
